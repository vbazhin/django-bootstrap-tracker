Simple django app that allows to manage issues, to set runtime for the task, and discuss it. 

Built on django-1.4 and Twitter Bootstrap 2.0.2 and jQuery.

Very minimalistic. 
The main idea was to make usage simple. 
- No project support. 
- No user groups.  

User invites can be sent by superusers.

You can download it and run on your server.
